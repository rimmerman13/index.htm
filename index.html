        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>Hi, everyone! My name is RJ Immerman, and I am a current Graduate
          Certificate student. This will be my last quarter here at DU, and
          at the end of the summer, I will be moving to Orlando, Florida to
          begin my Master's in Architectural Studies, with a focus in
          Themed Entertainment. I currently work for the Walt Disney Company
          in Anaheim, California; I hold a B.A. in Political Science, and my
          background is in Master Planning.

          While I love learning and being in school, I also have passions out-
          side of school such as:</p>
